- Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

- Open VScode > Open Kernel (top right)> select installed python 
    - If cannot find any python (even tho already installed): 
        - The reason may be because there are duplicate python.
        - You can find duplicate python with `cmd` > type `where python` > go to the "self-installed" Microsoft Python path and delete it.

    - `pip install numpy`
    - `pip install scikit-learn`
    - `pip install pandas`
    - `pip install tensorflow`
    - `pip install matplotlib`
