# Data Science

#### This is a collection of all the projects I have learn and practice on.

**To Run this project:**
- Install [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
- Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

- Open VScode > Open Kernel (top right)> select installed python 
    - If cannot find any python (even tho already installed): 
        - The reason may be because there are duplicate python.
        - You can find duplicate python with `cmd` > type `where python` > go to the "self-installed" Microsoft Python path and delete it.
